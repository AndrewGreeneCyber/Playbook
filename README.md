<h1>Using a Playbook</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved handling a phishing incident using a structured playbook. An alert indicated that a user might have downloaded and opened a malicious file from a phishing email. The playbook guided the response process, including reviewing the alert, identifying discrepancies in the email, analyzing the malicious attachment, and escalating the ticket to a level-two SOC analyst for further investigation. The project emphasized the importance of systematic and consistent incident response to mitigate security threats effectively.
